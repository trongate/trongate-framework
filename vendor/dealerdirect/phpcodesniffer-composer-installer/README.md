This composer installer plugin allows for easy installation of [PHP_CodeSniffer][codesniffer] coding standards (rulesets).

No more symbolic linking of directories, checking out repositories on specific locations or changing
the `phpcs` configuration.

## Usage

Installation can be done with [Composer][composer], by requiring this package as a development dependency:

```bash
composer require --dev dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer
```

When using Composer 2.2 or higher, Composer will [ask for your permission](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-2/#more-secure-plugin-execution) to allow this plugin to execute code. For this plugin to be functional, permission needs to be granted.

When permission has been granted, the following snippet will automatically be added to your `composer.json` file by Composer:
```json
{
    "config": {
        "allow-plugins": {
            "dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer": true
        }
    }
}
```

When using Composer < 2.2, you can add the permission flag ahead of the upgrade to Composer 2.2, by running:
```bash
composer config allow-plugins.dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer true
```

That's it.

### Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with:

- PHP **5.4+**, **7.x**, and **8.x** (Support for PHP v8 is available since [`v0.7.0`][v0.7])
- [Composer][composer] **1.x** and **2.x** (Support for Composer v2 is available since [`v0.7.0`][v0.7])
- [PHP_CodeSniffer][codesniffer] **2.x** and **3.x** (Support for PHP_CodeSniffer v3 is available since [`v0.4.0`][v0.4])


> **ℹ️ Please Note:** [Composer treats _minor_ releases below 1.0.0 as _major_ releases][composer-manual-caret]. So version `0.7.x` (or higher) of this plugin must be _explicitly_ set as version constraint when using Composer 2.x or PHP 8.0. In other words: using `^0.6` will **not** work with Composer 2.x or PHP 8.0.

### How it works

Basically, this plugin executes the following steps:

- This plugin searches for [`phpcodesniffer-standard` packages][] in all of your currently installed Composer packages.
- Matching packages and the project itself are scanned for PHP_CodeSniffer rulesets.
- The plugin will call PHP_CodeSniffer and configure the `installed_paths` option.

### Example project

The following is an example Composer project and has included
multiple `phpcodesniffer-standard` packages.

```json
{
    "name": "example/project",
    "description": "Just an example project",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {},
    "require-dev": {
        "dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer": "*",
        "object-calisthenics/phpcs-calisthenics-rules": "*",
        "phpcompatibility/php-compatibility": "*",
        "wp-coding-standards/wpcs": "*"
    },
    "config": {
        "allow-plugins": {
            "dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer": true
        }
    }
}
```

After running `composer install` PHP_CodeSniffer just works:

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpcs -i
The installed coding standards are MySource, PEAR, PSR1, PSR2, PSR12, Squiz, Zend, ObjectCalisthenics,
PHPCompatibility, WordPress, WordPress-Core, WordPress-Docs and WordPress-Extra
```

### Calling the plugin directly

In some circumstances, it is desirable to call this plugin's functionality
directly. For instance, during development or in [CI][definition-ci] environments.

As the plugin requires Composer to work, direct calls need to be wired through a
project's `composer.json`.

This is done by adding a call to the `Plugin::run` function in the `script`
section of the `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "install-codestandards": [
            "PHPCSStandards\\Composer\\Plugin\\Installers\\PHPCodeSniffer\\Plugin::run"
        ]
    }
}
```

The command can then be called using `composer run-script install-codestandards` or
referenced from other script configurations, as follows:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "install-codestandards": [
            "PHPCSStandards\\Composer\\Plugin\\Installers\\PHPCodeSniffer\\Plugin::run"
        ],
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "@install-codestandards"
        ]
    }
}
```

For more details about Composer scripts, please refer to [the section on scripts
in the Composer manual][composer-manual-scripts].

### Changing the Coding Standards search depth

By default, this plugin searches up for Coding Standards up to three directories
deep. In most cases, this should be sufficient. However, this plugin allows
you to customize the search depth setting if needed.

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "phpcodesniffer-search-depth": 5
    }
}
```

### Caveats

When this plugin is installed globally, composer will load the _global_ plugin rather
than the one from the local repository. Despite [this behavior being documented
in the composer manual][using-composer-plugins], it could potentially confuse
as another version of the plugin could be run and not the one specified by the project.

## Developing Coding Standards

Coding standard can be developed normally, as documented by [PHP_CodeSniffer][codesniffer], in the [Coding Standard Tutorial][tutorial].

Create a composer package of your coding standard by adding a `composer.json` file.

```json
{
  "name" : "acme/phpcodesniffer-our-standards",
  "description" : "Package contains all coding standards of the Acme company",
  "require" : {
    "php" : ">=5.4.0",
    "squizlabs/php_codesniffer" : "^3.6"
  },
  "type" : "phpcodesniffer-standard"
}
```

Requirements:
* The repository may contain one or more standards.
* Each standard can have a separate directory no deeper than 3 levels from the repository root.
* The package `type` must be `phpcodesniffer-standard`. Without this, the plugin will not trigger.

### Requiring the plugin from within your coding standard

If your coding standard itself depends on additional external PHPCS standards, this plugin can
make life easier on your end-users by taking care of the installation of all standards - yours
and your dependencies - for them.

This can help reduce the number of support questions about setting the `installed_paths`, as well
as simplify your standard's installation instructions.

For this to work, make sure your external standard adds this plugin to the `composer.json` config
via `require`, **not** `require-dev`.

> :warning: Your end-user may already `require-dev` this plugin and/or other external standards used
> by your end-users may require this plugin as well.
>
> To prevent your end-users getting into "_dependency hell_", make sure to make the version requirement
> for this plugin flexible.
>
> As, for now, this plugin is still regarded as "unstable" (version < 1.0), remember that Composer
> treats unstable minors as majors and will not be able to resolve one config requiring this plugin
> at version `^0.5`, while another requires it at version `^0.6`.
> Either allow multiple minors or use `*` as the version requirement.
>
> Some examples of flexible requirements which can be used:
> ```bash
> composer require dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer:"*"
> composer require dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer:"0.*"
> composer require dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer:"^0.4.1 || ^0.5 || ^0.6 || ^0.7"
> ```
