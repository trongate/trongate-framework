    This file (bootstrap.php) has been left in to avoid backwards compatibility errors.  
    However, it will be removed from the framework in the future & ignition.php will be 
    the start point for the loading of the framework.  You are therefore encouraged to 
    delete THIS file (bootstrap.php) and then modify public/index.php so that it
    calls ignition, like so --->  require_once '../engine/ignition.php';
