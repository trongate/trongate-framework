   GitHub stars are the metric by which the success of frameworks gets measured. We need 1,200 GitHub stars to make Trongate a top ten PHP framework. If Trongate becomes a top ten PHP framework it will be one of the most electrifying events in the history of PHP!

## :star2: About the Project

<div align="left"> 
  <p>Trongate was built with a love of pure PHP and a belief that PHP is best when it's easy, stable and fast. Trongate uses PHP the way that PHP was originally intended to be used, i.e., as a templating engine. Trongate is the only PHP framework that actively rejects; PSR-4 auto-loading, Composer, Packagist, rewrite culture, certification and all forms of bureaucracy.</p>
  <p>
Trongate is also the first PHP framework that has been built with a determination to remain v1 forever. Finally, PHP developers have framework that has been built with stability as a priority.</p>

  <p>The Trongate framework will never contain features that developers don't need. Trongate will never offer certification - paid or unpaid. Instead, Trongate will continue to boldly tackle real problems that face real developers every day.</p>

  <p>The Trongate framework is free. The Trongate desktop app is also free. These things will always be free. That's a promise!</p>
  <h1>Is this fast enough for you?</h1>
  <p>Trongate favours pure PHP over things like PSR-4 autoloading. The result? A brave new PHP framework that demolishes the competition based on every metric that counts. Pure PHP is back!</p>
